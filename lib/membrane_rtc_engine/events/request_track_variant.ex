  Event for changing track variant that is currently being received.

  Sending this event will cause the engine to send a keyframe request
  event to the track origin. Once the engine receives a keyframe
  for the requested track variant, it will start forwarding it to
  the requester.

  If the requested track variant becomes inactive before being delivered
  it has to be re-requested when it becomes active again.
