# WebRTC Media Events

This document described all messages exchanged between the WebRTC Endpoint and a client.
In general, each media event has to be sent in the form:

```json
{
  type: name,
  data: data
}
```

where the name of the event is the value of the `type` field, while `data` should carry the data shown below for every media event

## Table of contents

Below you can find a summary of all media events defined inside `membrane_rtc_engine`

  }
  ```

### `sdpOffer`

  and this track's bitrates (or all of its variants bitrates) and a mapping between `mid` and `track_id`.
  Maps contain only information about current client's `sendonly` tracks.

## WebRTC Enpoint -> Client

### `offerData`

  to the client and information regarding the integrated TURN server.

  ```json
  {
    tracksTypes: {
      audio: Int,
      video: Int

      transport: string,
      password: string,
      username: string

    midToTrackId: mid_to_track_id
  }
  ```

### `encodingSwitched`

* Informs that track with id `trackId` belonging to endpoint with id `endpointId` will be sent in encoding `encoding` now.
The meaning is as follows:
* "low_bandwidth" - we no longer have enough bandwidth to maintain current track quality
* "encoding_inactive" - encoding became inactive
* "other" - it was hard to determine exact reason of encoding switch

  ```json
  {
    endpointId: endpoint_id,
    trackId: track_id,
    encoding: encoding,
    reason: "low_bandwidth" | "encoding_inactive" | "other"
  }
  ```

### `vadNotification`
* Informs that the track denoted by `trackId` has changed their voice actiivty
* For this notification to work, the server must be configured to use VAD extension
  and the sender must support it.

```json
{
  trackId: track_id,
  status: "silence" | "speech"
}
```

### `bandwidthEstimation`
* Informs about client's available incoming bitrate (a.k.a. download) estimated by the server.
  It is measured in bits per second.
* For this notification to work, the server must be configured to use TWCC extension
  and the sender must support it.

```json
{
  estimation: estimation,
}
```
