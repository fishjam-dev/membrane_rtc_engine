## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `membrane_rtc_engine` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

## Developing

To make the development a little easier, we augmented `mix compile` and `mix docs` tasks so that `mix compile` also installs npm dependencies and compiles TypeScript code
and `mix docs` also generates documentation for TypeScript code.

Thanks to this, there is no need to include compiled JS code in `priv/static`. It will be generated each time `mix compile` is called.

TypeScript documentation will be generated under `doc/js/`.
