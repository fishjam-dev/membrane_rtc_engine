# Media Events

This document described all messages exchanged between the RTC Engine and a client.
In general, each media event has to be sent in the form:

```json
{
  type: name,
  data: data
}
```

where the name of the event is the value of the `type` field, while `data` should carry the data shown below for every media event

## Table of contents

Below you can find a summary of all media events defined inside `membrane_rtc_engine`
