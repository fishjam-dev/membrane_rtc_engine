# Upgrading to v0.14

Version 0.14 removes the concept of peers from the RTC Engine meaning that RTC Engine
only operates on Endpoints.

In practice, most changes come down to updating callback names.

## RTC Engine (Elixir)

Instead of `peer_id` or `endpoint_id` use `id`:

```diff
- :ok = Engine.add_endpoint(state.rtc_engine, endpoint, peer_id: peer_id, node: peer_node)
+ :ok = Engine.add_endpoint(state.rtc_engine, endpoint, id: peer_id, node: peer_node)
```

## SDK (JS)

`MembraneWebRTC` class was renamed to `WebRTCEndpoint`.
It also no longer takes callbacks in the constructor.
Instead, you have to subscribe for events:

```diff
- const webrtc = new MembraneWebRTC({callbacks: {}})
+ const webrtc = new WebRTCEndpoint();
```

| callback | event |
| --- | --- |
| onSendMediaEvent | webrtc.on("sendMediaEvent") |
| onConnectionError | webrtc.on("connectionError") |
| onJoinSuccess | webrtc.on("connected") |
| onTrackReady | webrtc.on("trackReady") |
| onTrackAdded | webrtc.on("trackAdded") |
| onTrackRemoved | webrtc.on("trackRemoved") |
| onPeerJoined | webrtc.on("endpointAdded") |
| onPeerLeft | webrtc.on("endpointRemoved") |
| onTrackUpdated | webrtc.on("trackUpdated") |
| onTrackEncodingChanged | trackCtx.on("encodingChanged") |
| onJoinError | removed |


The process of "connecting" SDK to the RTC Engine endpoint is all about sending
a single message indicating SDK readiness.
Therefore, instead of using `onJoinError`, a user is expected to observe its transport status (in most cases WS connection)
and can add tracks as soon as `connect` function has been called.

It's important that `endpointAdded` event will be emitted for every endpoint added to the engine.
You can filter out endpoints by their type i.e.

```ts
webrtc.on("endpointAdded", (endpoint: Endpoint) => {
   if (endpoint.type === "webrtc") {
    // do something
   }
});
```

### Connecting

```diff
- webrtc.join(peerMetadata);
+ webrtc.connect(metadata);
```

### Leaving

```diff
- webrtc.leave();
+ webrtc.disconnect();
```
